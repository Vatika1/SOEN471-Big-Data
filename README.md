Abstract

The covid-19 pandemic has led to an immense loss around the globe affecting the health care system, food system, global economy and not the least, people's mental health. There have been millions of deaths around the world. The lockdowns imposed across the world took a huge toll on the global economy. In this project, we aim to explore the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy.  The dataset chosen shows the economical impact of this pandemic in 170 countries. The overall size of the data is 9.56 mb consisting of raw data (5.54 mb) and transformed data (4.03 mb). The latest information on the economy is till October 18th, 2020. The transformed data file contains 9 columns: code, country, date, human development index, total cases, total deaths, stringency index, population and GDP per capita. On the other hand, the raw data file contains 14 columns (9 columns are same as transformed data file), whereas the data is not well defined in 5 columns.

We will analyse the dataset and will perform predictive analysis on the dataset to forecast the impact on the GDP per capita after October 2020 by taking all the parameters into account.
